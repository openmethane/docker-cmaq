C *** calculate 3rd moment intermodal transfer rate by coagulation
      C30ATAC = C3IJ * MOMENT0_CONC( 1 ) * MOMENT0_CONC( 2 )

C *** TAKE ONE FORWARD TIME STEP - Solve Modal Dynamics Equations
C     This code implements Section 1.4 of Binkowski and Roselle (2003)
C     with two notable exceptions.  1) emissions are treated in
C     CMAQ's vertical diffusion routine, so they do not appear in the
C     following equations. 2) new particle formation and condensational
C     growth are now treated in the VOLINORG subroutine, so they do not
C     appear in the following equations.
 
C     M2 is updated before M0 because the intermodal transfer rate of
C     M2 is a function of the number concentrations.  In contrast,
C     production and loss rates of M0 are independent of M2.  Advancing
C     M2 before M0 avoids operator splitting within the modal-dynamic-
C     equation solution.  A similar rearrangement would be necessary
C     for the M3 update, but the dependence of M3 on number
C     concentrations already is accounted for in the C30ATAC term.

C *** UPDATE SECOND MOMENT
C     For each lognormal mode, solve equations of form:
C       dM2/dt = P2 - L2*M2   ! if L2 > 0
C     with solution
C       M2(t) = P2/L2 + ( M2(t0) - P2/L2 ) * exp( -L2*dt )
C     OR
C       dM2/dt = P2           ! if L2 = 0
C     with solution
C       M2(t) = M2(t0) + P2*dt

C *** Aitken mode: initial value of M2
      M20 = MOMENT2_CONC( 1 )

C *** Loss of 2nd moment from Aitken mode is due to intermodal
C     coagulation with accumulation mode and intramodal coagulation.
C     Production term is removed, because new particle formation
C     and condensational growth are accounted for in VOLINORG.
      LOSS = (
     &        ( BATAT( 2 ) * MOMENT0_CONC( 1 )
     &        + BATAC( 2 ) * MOMENT0_CONC( 2 ) ) * MOMENT0_CONC( 1 )
     &       ) / M20

C *** Solve for M2_Aitken based on LOSS during this time step
C     Note: LOSS is assumed to be non-negative.
      IF ( LOSS .GT. 0.0 ) THEN

      ELSE
         Y = M20
      END IF ! test on loss

C *** Transfer new value of M2_Aitken to the array
      MOMENT2_CONC( 1 ) = MAX( REAL( AEROMODE( 1 )%MIN_M2 ), REAL( Y ) )

C *** Accumulation mode: initial value of M2
      M20 = MOMENT2_CONC( 2 )

C *** Production of 2nd moment in accumulation mode is due to
C     intermodal coagulation Aitken mode
      PROD = BACAT( 2 ) * MOMENT0_CONC( 1 ) * MOMENT0_CONC( 2 )

C *** Loss of 2nd moment from accumulation mode is due only to
C     intramodal coagulation
      LOSS = ( BACAC( 2 ) * MOMENT0_CONC( 2 ) * MOMENT0_CONC( 2 ) ) / M20

C *** Solve for M2_accum based on PROD and LOSS during this time step
C     Note: LOSS is assumed to be non-negative.
      IF ( LOSS .GT. 0.0 ) THEN
         POL = PROD / LOSS

      END IF ! test on loss

C *** Transfer new value of M2_accum to moment array
      MOMENT2_CONC( 2 ) = MAX( REAL( AEROMODE( 2 )%MIN_M2 ), REAL( Y ) )

C *** Coarse mode: no change because coagulation of coarse particles
C     is neglected in current model version.

C *** end of update for second moment

C *** Update Zeroth Moment (i.e. number concentration)

C *** Aitken mode: initial value of M0

      Y0 = MOMENT0_CONC( 1 )

C *** The rate of change for M0_Aitken is described in Equation 8a of
C     Binkowski & Roselle (2003), with the c_i term equal to 0.

      A = BATAT( 1 )                      ! intramodal coagulation

      END IF

C *** Transfer new value of M0_Aitken to the moment array

C *** Accumulation mode: initial value of M0
      Y0 = MOMENT0_CONC( 2 )

C *** The rate of change for M0_accum is described in Equation 8b of
C     Binkowski & Roselle (2003), except the coefficient C is zero
C     because emissions are treated outside the CMAQ aerosol module.
C     The equation reduces to the form: dY/dt = -A * Y**2 , where
      A = BACAC( 1 )                 ! intramodal coagulation

C *** Solve for M0_accum using Smoluchowski's solution
      Y = Y0 / ( 1.0D0 + A * Y0 * DT )

C *** Transfer new value of M0_accum to the moment array
      MOMENT0_CONC( 2 ) = MAX( AEROMODE( 2 )%MIN_NUM, REAL( Y ) )

C *** end of update for zeroth moment - note that the coarse mode number does
C     not change because coarse-mode coagulation is neglected in the model

C *** UPDATE MASS CONCENTRATIONS (for each species)
C     The following procedure is described in Paragraphs 21-23
C     of Binkowski & Roselle (2003), except the Ei,n and Ej,n terms
C     are excluded here because emissions are treated outside the
C     CMAQ aerosol module.

C     Aitken mode mass concentration rates of change are of the form:
C       dc/dt = P - L*c    ! Equation 9a of Binkowski & Roselle (2003)
C     with solution
C       c(t0 + dt) = P/L + ( c(t0) - P/L ) * exp(-L*dt)

C     For all species, loss of Aitken mode mass is due to intermodal
C     coagulation.
C       LOSSn = PI/6 * RHOn * C30ATAC / MASSn
C       RHOn  = MASSn / (M3 * PI/6)
C     When above equations are combined, the PI/6 terms cancel yielding
C       LOSSn = C30ATAC / M3
C     where LOSSn is the loss rate of species n, RHOn is the mass of
C     species n per unit of particle volume, C30ATAC is the 3rd moment
C     loss rate due to intermodal coagulation, MASSn is the mass
C     concentration of species n, and M3 is the 3rd moment
C     concentration.

      LOSS = C30ATAC / MOMENT3_CONC( 1 )

C *** Set up extra variables to solve for Aitken mode mass concentrations
      FACTRANS = LOSS * DT
      EXPDT = EXP( -FACTRANS )
      LOSSINV = 1.0 / LOSS

C *** Secondary Organics and Inorganics
C     These species are produced by condensation, but their mass
C     concentrations have been updated in subroutine VOLINORG.  Therefore,
C     only the mass transfer due to intermodal coagulation is
C     treated here.

C *** Mode Merging
C     This code implements Section 1.5 of Binkowski and Roselle (2003).
C     If the Aitken mode mass is growing faster than accumulation mode
C     mass and the Aitken mode number concentration exceeds the
C     accumulation mode number concentration, then modes are merged by
C     renaming.

C *** Calculate AAA = ln( Dij / DGATK ) / ( SQRT2 * XXLSGAT ), where Dij
C     is the diameter at which the Aitken-mode and accumulation-mode
C     number distributions intersect (i.e., overlap).  AAA is equivalent
C     to the "Xnum" term described below Equation 10a by Binkowski and

C *** Calculates the partitioning of inorganic components (CL,NO3,NH4,SO4)
C     between the aerosol and gas phase over the operator synchronization
C     timestep (DT). Partitioning is calculated using the Hybrid approach,
C     where dynamic mass transfer of species to/from the coarse mode is
C     calculated using multiple sub-operator time steps (TSTEP) and the
C     fine modes are equilibrated with the gas phase. The mass transfer
C     calculations are made using the H+ flux-limiting approach of Pilinis
C     et al. (2000). If 'OPTIONFLAG' is not set to 'Hybrid', the mass
C     transfer calculations for the coarse mode are skipped, and the fine
C     modes are equilibrated with the gas phase.

C     Returns updated volatile inorganic species concentrations in the gas
C     and particulate phase, and the aerosol modal parameters

C *** Revision history: 4/07 - Moved HCOND3 and NEWPART3 calls from

C     mode.  The "omega" factors are defined in Equations 7a and 7b of
C     Binkowski & Shankar (1995). The i-mode and j-mode factors are 
C     calculated using Equation A17 of Binkowski & Shankar (1995). The 
C     condensation rate for accumulation mode (fine-equilibrium scheme) or 
C     coarse mode (hybrid and dynamic schemes) is computed by difference, 
C     to avoid mass conservation violations arising from numerical error.

C     Calculate the production rate of number, sulfate mass, and 2nd
C     moment, due to the H2SO4/H2O nucleation assuming that each critical
C     nucleus grows instantaneously to 2.0 nm.  This code follows Section
C     1.2 of Binkowski & Roselle (2003), except the assumed particle
C     diameter has been changed from 3.5 to 2.0 nm.

C *** Convert production rate of number to [ #/m**3 s]

C     H2SO4, and adjust the number production rate accordingly.

C   Compute_Flux
 
C DESCRIPTION
C   Determines the evaporative/condensational flux of volatile
C   inorganic species to aerosol modes. In cases where the resulting H+
C   flux is greater than a specified limit, the Pilinis et al. (2000)
C   AS&T approach is used to modify species vapor pressures such that
C   cond./evap. produces an H+ flux equal to the limit (which is
C   proportional to the current mode concentration of H+).
